#### Course Description

The technological revolution has allowed to capture, display, store and process images for almost any
domain including astronomy, biomedical imaging, surveillance and remote sensing, computer vision (e.g.
robots, license plate readers, and tracking human motion), and security and digital rights management (e.g.
watermarking, biometrics). Some important examples of image processing tasks are cleaning up noisy and
blurred images due to imperfect imaging sensors and illumination issues, detection of objects for
recognition and tracking, and compressing images for transmission and sharing via social media and video
watching.

This course will provide both the theory behind the fundamental image processing tasks and the hands-on
training to develop, implement, evaluate and interpret key processing tasks in practice. Example images
from publically available datasets for specific applications and imaging research projects will be utilized to
demonstrate both theory and practice. The image processing techniques will be implemented using
MATLAB, the most used software package in image processing. Real world hands on experience is one of
the highlights of this course, in which students are expected to implement various image processing
techniques in several smaller assignments and a bigger quarter long project.

The topics covered in the course include:

- components of an image processing system and its applications
- elements of visual perception
- sampling and quantization
- image filtering and enhancement
- color spaces and transformations
- segmentation
- morphological image processing.
