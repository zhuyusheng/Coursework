#### Course Description
The course will teach advanced statistical techniques to discover information from large sets of data. The
course topics include visualization techniques to summarize and display high dimensional data,
dimensional reduction techniques such as principal component analysis and factor analysis, clustering
techniques for discovering patterns from large datasets, and classification techniques for decision making.
The methods will be implemented using standard computer packages.

#### Course Goals
At the end of this course, the student should have a basic understanding of the following topics and be able
to identify which approach is appropriate for a given data set and data analysis task to be performed:

- Multivariate linear regression (least-square estimation & normal equations, model building &
variable selection)
- Principal component analysis & Factor analysis (Eigen-values and eigenvectors, scree plots,
dimension reduction, factor rotation)
- Canonical Correlation (to assess the relationship between two sets of variables)
- Discriminant analysis (Fisher's discriminant function)
- Cluster analysis (similarity measures, hierarchical clustering & non-hierarchical clustering).
- Multidimensional Scaling (if time permits)
