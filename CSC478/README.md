### CSC 481 Programming  Machine  Learning  Applications 
***
#### COURSE DESCRIPTION

The course will focus on the implementations of various data mining and machine learning techniques and their applications in various domains. The primary tools used in the class are the Python programming language and several associated libraries. Additional open source machine learning and data mining tools may also be used as part of the class material and assignments. Students will develop hands on experience developing supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms and will learn how to employ these techniques in the context of popular applications such as automatic classification, recommender systems, searching and ranking, text mining, group and community discovery, and social media analytics.
